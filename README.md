# magic-startup-arch-sh
## What it does
This script allows to speed up the installation process
of your computer in case of a fresh installation of an operating system based on arch.

This script has been developed using an arch-based distro, therefore you should have at least pacman installed on your system.

> Please install pacman!!!  ·óß¬∑¬∑¬∑üçí¬∑¬∑¬∑·ó£ 

Features:
- install packages from pacman
- install packages from aur

- use my personal dotfiles files

## FAQ
Q: How to add other programs that needs to be installed by pacman / yay?
- You can customize each list by adding or removing entries in the script in the variables 'pacapps' and 'aurapps'.

Q: Can I use other separators than space character as you've done?
- No, each program is separated by a space: **DON'T** use any other separator.

Q: I wrote 'neofotch' but it doesn't install neofetch. What should I do? 
- You will need to know the exact name of the package.

**For instance**: if you want to install IntelliJ by using aur, you can't simply add "IntelliJ" to aurapps.

First, search what is the name of a proper IntelliJ package on aur; once you've figured out (it is "intellij-idea-ultimate-edition"), place this name enclosed with double quotes in the array of `aurapps` in the script.

In the end, you should have something like this:
```
aurapps=("sublime" "zoom" "intellij-idea-ultimate-edition")
```
Q: Where did you tested this script?
- EndeavourOS Linux x86_64 with bash 5.0.18, it should works great on Manjaro and arch too.
